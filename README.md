In this tutorial we worked on web api. We create web api using Asp.net. 
# Asp.net Web API
The ASP.NET Web API is an extensible framework for building HTTP based services that can be accessed in different applications on different platforms such as web, windows, mobile etc. It works more or less the same way as ASP.NET MVC web application except that it sends data as a response instead of html view. It is like a webservice or WCF service but the exception is that it only supports HTTP protocol.

# TodoApi
In this tutorial we build Web API for managing a list of "to-do" items. 

# ToDOAPI mobile app
This tutorial demonstrates how to create backend services using ASP.NET Core MVC to support native mobile apps. It uses the Xamarin Forms ToDoRest app as its native client, which includes separate native clients for Android, iOS, Windows Universal, and Window Phone devices. 

# Contact Manager
In this tuturial we Build RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Web API. This is the older version, and it was built using MVC 4, but Visual Studio 2017 doesn't have MVC 4, so I simply create asp.net framework web api, well it worked fine.
